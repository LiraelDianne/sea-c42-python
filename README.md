### Life
I am a Washingtonian born and raised (complete with duck webbing between toes).  I live in a crazy awesome apartment in Bothell with my creative roomate.  My interests include (but are not limited to) hiking, astronomy, the internet, linguistics, fantasy/sci-fi, cats, solving puzzles, and making people laugh. I'm currently reading [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/).
### Music
In college, I pursued a major in Music Education (Bachelor's + teacher certification).  I'm currently teaching piano and violin lessons, many through Music Lessons on Wheels, an organization that brings piano lessons into after-school programs all over the Seattle area.
### Programming
I've always been excited by the challenge of logic puzzles and math, and I was introduced to coding by my high school piano teacher of all people.  I wanted to pursue it further, but was unsure how to find resources to continue.  Later in 2012 I found and completed most of Codecademy's Code Year.  Now that I've found the awesome program at Code Fellows, I'm looking forward to pushing myself as far as I can go.
#### Python
Python has attracted me ever since I encountered it on Codecademy, and I'm intrigued by the potential applications people keep bringing up – data analysis, machine learning – even CGI.
